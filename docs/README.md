I would like to include support for the **Xbox Elite Wireless Controller**, therefore I started a [crowdfunding](https://www.leetchi.com/de/Cagnotte/46484080/b73f2096) project. It would be great if some of you would donate some cents for the necessary hardware.

This is the first and yet only driver for the Xbox One Wireless Gamepad (which is shipped with the Xbox One S). I wrote it for a student project at fortiss GmbH and it is fully functional but does only support the connection via Bluetooth as yet - more will follow.

Many thanks to *Kai Krakow* who **sponsored** me a Xbox One Wireless Controller :video_game: (including Wireless Adapter) and a pack of mouthwatering guarana cacao :coffee:

**Advantages of this driver**
* Supports Bluetooth
* Supports Force Feedback (Rumble) in General
* Supports [Trigger Force Feedback](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4PHupKm2OQ) (not even supported in Windows)  
  see it in action: run `misc/tools/directional_rumble_test/direction_rumble_test <event# in /dev/input>`
* Supports disabling FF
* Supports multiple Gamepads at the same time (not even supported in Windows)
* Offers a consistent mapping, even if the Gamepad was paired to Windows/Xbox before
* Working Select, Start, Mode buttons
* Correct Axis Range (signed, important for e.g. RPCS3)
* Supports Battery Level Indication (including the Play \`n Charge Kit)  
  ![Battery Level Indication](./img/battery_support.png)
* Supports faking the Input Device Version in order to prevent SDL from trying to fix an unbroken mapping.
* Easy Installation
* Agile Support and Development

## Getting started
### Prerequisites
Make sure you have installed *dkms*, *linux headers* and a bluetooth implementation (e.g. *bluez*) and their dependencies.

* On **Arch** and Arch-based distros (like **Antergos**), try  
  `sudo pacman -S dkms linux-headers bluez bluez-utils`  
* On **Debian** based systems (like Ubuntu) you can install those packages by running  
  ``sudo apt-get install dkms linux-headers-`uname -r` ``  
* On **Fedora**, it is  
  ``sudo dnf install dkms bluez bluez-tools kernel-devel-`uname -r` kernel-headers-`uname -r` `` 
* On **OSMC** you will have to run the following commands  
  ``sudo apt-get install dkms rbp2-headers-`uname -r` ``  
  ``sudo ln -s "/usr/src/rbp2-headers-`uname -r`" "/lib/modules/`uname -r`/build"`` (as a [workaround](https://github.com/osmc/osmc/issues/471))
* On **Raspbian**, it is  
  `sudo apt-get install dkms raspberrypi-kernel-headers`  
  If you recently updated your firmware using `rpi-update` the above package may not yet include the header files for your kernel.  
  Please follow the steps described at [rpi-src](https://github.com/notro/rpi-source/wiki) to get the headers for your currently running kernel.  
  
Please feel free to add other Distributions as well!

### Installation
* Download the Repository to your local machine 
  `git clone https://github.com/atar-axis/xpadneo.git`
* `cd xpadneo`
* Run `./install.sh`
* Done!

### Connection
* `sudo bluetoothctl`
* `[bluetooth]# scan on`
* push the connect button on upper side of the gamepad, and hold it down, until the light starts flashing fast
* wait for the gamepad to show up in bluetoothctl, remember the MAC address (C8:3F:26:XX:XX:XX)
* `[bluetooth]# pair <MAC>`
* `[bluetooth]# trust <MAC>`
* `[bluetooth]# connect <MAC>`

You know that everything works fine when you feel the gamepad rumble ;)

> **The gamepad did not rumble ?** Secure Boot may be enabled on your computer. On most Linux distribution, running `mokutil --sb-state` will tell you if it is the case. When Secure Boot is enabled, unsigned kernel module cannot be loaded. Two options are available:
> 1. Disable Secure Boot.
> 2. Sign the module yourself.
> Instructions for both of these options are available [here](https://atar-axis.github.io/xpadneo/#working-with-secure-boot).
>
> Secure Boot is not enabled and pairing still fails? See [Debugging](https://atar-axis.github.io/xpadneo/#debugging).

### Configuration
The driver can be reconfigured at runtime by accessing the following sysfs
files in `/sys/module/hid_xpadneo/parameters`:

* `debug_level` (default `0`)
  * `0` (no debug output) to `3` (all)
  * For more information, please take a look [here](https://atar-axis.github.io/xpadneo/#debugging)
* `disable_ff` (default `0`)
  * `0` (ff enabled) to `1` (ff disabled)
* `trigger_rumble_damping` (default `4`)
  * Damp the strength of the trigger force feedback
  * `1` (none) to `256` (max)
* `fake_dev_version` (default `0x1130`)
  * Fake the input device version to the given value (to prevent SDL from applying another mapping, see below)
  * Values from `1` to `0xFFFF` are handled as a version number, `0` will retain the original version
* `combined_z_axis` (default `0`)
  * Combine the triggers (`ABS_Z` and `ABS_RZ`) to form a single axis `ABS_Z` which is used e.g. in flight simulators
  * The left and right trigger will work against each other.

Some settings may need to be changed at loading time of the module, take a look at the following example to see how that works:
  
**Example**
To set the highest level of debug verbosity temporarily, run  
`echo 3 | sudo tee /sys/module/hid_xpadneo/parameters/debug_level`  
To make the setting permanent and applied at loading time, try  
`echo "options hid_xpadneo debug_level=3" | sudo tee /etc/modprobe.d/xpadneo.conf`

### Update
In order to update xpadneo, do the following
* Update your cloned directory (and reset all locally changes files) by running
  * `git reset --hard`
  * `git pull`
* Run `./update.sh`

### Uninstallation
* Run `./uninstall.sh` to remove all installed versions of hid-xpadneo

## Further information

If someone is interested in helping me getting this driver merged into the kernel, tell me. I would really appreciate that.
