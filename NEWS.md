# Changes since v0.9.1 up to v0.9.2

This is a maintenance release of xpadneo v0.9 to fix several issues found in
the current v0.10 development branch.

Thanks to contributors Emil Velikov, @PetitMote, @Mikaka27 and @rdrms, we now
have better compatibility with kernels 5.12 or later, latest DKMS versions, and
improved documentation.

We also fixed an issue conforming to the Linux input spec better which improves
compatibility with jinput and probably also the Chrome browser by not exposing
keyboard mapping bits on a joystick device. Thanks to @markpaters for pointing
that out.

Also, the current firmware generation seems to be unstable with our previous
rumble throttling interval and we had to increase this to 50ms. This actually
matches what the kernel is supposed to use for ff-memless emulation (but
apparently it may still send rumble commands faster). Thus, it's recommended
that anybody updates to this driver version.

Current kernels seem to cache devices when rebinding drivers. This affects our
udev rules, and needed fixups won't be properly applied because the original
VID/PID is no longer visible to us. We fixed this by reverting to the original
VID/PID on device unbinding.

Due to the various compatibility fixes, this is a highly recommended update.


## Compatibility issues

We found an issue with the OpenRGB and QMK Firmware projects which enabled
world read/write permissions on rawhid devices unconditionally. While this may
be a security issue on its own, it also enabled SDL to access our hidraw device
in an incompatible way, leading to mapping problems for both axes and buttons,
and also rumble instabilities. Both projects seem to have fixed this issue
meanwhile but you may want to double-check you're updated to the latest
versions, especially if you're experiencing issues with Steam Proton games.


## Heads-up for package maintainers

Distributions shipping kernels 5.12 or later should no longer disable Bluetooth
ERTM unconditionally. In fact, it may even harm connection stability when
rumble is in use. For better stability, it's generally recommended to upgrade
controllers to the new BLE firmware variant (version 5.x and above) for
improved connection stability. To ease support, the firmware version will now
be logged to dmesg with a warning if an old unstable firmware is found.

You should also inform users who experience input or rumble latency issues to
adjust the Bluetooth latency parameters but this may be fixed in later bluez
versions.

# Changes since v0.9 up to v0.9.1

This is a maintenance release of xpadneo v0.9 to fix several issues found
in the current v0.10 development branch.

Also, we've switched official maintainership to Kai Krakow and updated the
donation links accordingly. Coffee donations now directly reach the current
maintainer tho I may use it to buy hardware instead of coffee. :-)

The highlights of this release are better compatibility with current Proton
versions, fixes to Xbox One S|X controller support, removal of old dead
configuration options, updated and improved documentation, better
integration with DKMS, improved logging to aid issue resolving, future
proofing the systemd and udev integration, and deprecating support for
directional rumble which never properly worked.

This should be a smooth release for everyone.


## Configuration script

The `configure.sh` script no longer requires DKMS to be installed. On the
downside, it won't stop when the driver installation is missing but it
will instead complain and warn if the xpadneo driver is not loaded. Also,
supplying no options is evaluated as an error now.


## Heads up for package maintainers

This version handles DKMS installs and dynamic version file re-generation
a little different, you may need to adjust to package install scripts.


## Headlines:

  * dev: Fix gitignore
  * docs: Replace Ko-fi link to attribute donations to current maintainer (#274)
  * hid-xpadneo: Move share button quirk to `xpadneo_devices` database
  * installer, dkms: Fix trying to install the wrong udev filename

```

# Changes since v0.8 up to v0.9

*Quote of the day:*
> Good News, Everyone!

Much hard work of several weeks has gone into this release, so there's a big
reason to say thanks to all contributors, be it testing, suggestions, bug
reporting, or - of course - programming.

First of all, Michael Schmitt donated an Xbox Elite 2 controller, so we now
have full support for basic functionality of this controller, with support for
the advanced features coming in the v0.10 version of the driver. This builds
upon contributions done in the previous version of the driver.

Additionally, Ben Schattinger contributed support for the new Xbox Series X|S
controllers that were released by Microsoft with their new console generation.
Support for the new share button is still not finalized but it will generate a
key code. This new controller uses BLE (Bluetooth low energy) to connect to PC,
so you need a Bluetooth dongle that supports that features (most should do).

Both of you, Michael and Ben, qualified for the quote of the day. You guys
rock.

Also, some donations were provided by several people via Ko-fi. Thanks for
that, it's really appreciated. You guys are awesome!

Let's not forget all the people who contributed to the project patiently
providing feedback, bug reports, and testing, or even just a "thank you": This
release is our "thank you" back to the community.

Finally, we've got a logo now.

Here the gist of what the new version delivers:

  * Discord community (shared with xow, ask to join your project)
  * Code generation assertions
  * Start of code-redesign for splitting the driver core
  * Start of profile support (not implemented yet)
  * Dropped old debug mode
  * Better compliance with the Linux Gamepad specification
  * Improved driver documentation
  * Improved hardware documentation
  * Improved hardware support
  * Improved quirks handler to more easily handle hardware quirks
  * Improved HID handler performance
  * Improved dmesg logging
  * Improved DKMS installer
  * Improved rumble timing and precision
  * Improved rumble damping setting
  * Improved continuous integration testing
  * Added support for new hardware-level device functions
  * Added high-precision mode for the thumb sticks
  * Added option for disabling dead-zones for better Proton support

Many of the bug fixes have been backported to the v0.8 branch which has now
received its end of life. If you're having problems with the new features,
please report that and use the v0.8 branch until that specific bug is fixed.


## Known Problems

The Bluetooth stability of the Xbox controllers is still a known issue which we
probably can't fix in the driver. Some work-arounds are in place but that's not
a 100% guarantee. Some of these problems can even be observed when using the
controller with Windows. All the problems seem to mostly focus around using
rumble, so you may need to disable rumble.

The other class of problems is connecting/pairing the controller properly. This
seems to be a Linux kernel issue or a Bluez daemon issue, or a combination of
both. Usually, Windows doesn't show any problems here. Apparently, we cannot
fix this in the driver. You may want to report this to the kernel or Bluez
developers.

Always use the controller updated to its latest firmware before trying other
steps: Microsoft fixed some connection problems, and also HID implementation
details in the past with firmware updates.


## Breaking Changes

This release fixes button mappings for 8BitDo controllers to actually match
their names on the controller instead of matching positions with original Xbox
controllers. The X,Y and A,B buttons will be swapped compared to previous
versions.

This change is controversial but let me tell you that we are going to work on
changes that let you easily choose and switch behavior in v0.10.

The module parameter `debug_level` has been dropped. Some other parameters
have been dropped in favor of better replacements. Please reconfigure your
parameters and settings.


## The Future

The new controllers provide some new functionality at the hardware level which
we are going to try to emulate at the driver level for older generation
controllers. The prominent example for this is mapping profiles support: Until
we figured out how this is implemented in hardware for the Xbox Elite 2
controller, we won't implement any emulation support in the driver. This is
because we want to end up with an emulation that is 100% compatible with the
hardware implementation, and not end up with some customization functions that
needs emulation for the Xbox Elite 2 controller.

We are also going to split the driver into components to easily add support for
USB or GIP dongle connections, with USB probably coming first because the GIP
dongle still has licensing issues for using its firmware.

# Changes since v0.7 up to v0.8

*Quote of the day:*
> HID me baby, one more time!

Much hard work of several weeks has gone into this release, so there's a big
reason to say thanks to all contributors, be it testing, suggestions, bug
reporting, or - of course - programming.

Many thanks @medusalix for finally figuring out the underlying problems of
the disconnect behavior of the controller during rumble events: After some
internal discussion, we managed to find a race condition in the controller
firmware and worked around it by throttling the rumble reprogramming to
intervals of at least 10ms as this is what the controllers seems to accept
as the minimal interval without freaking out. As a "thank you", I contributed
a logically identical patch to the [xow](https://github.com/medusalix/xow)
project which has not been merged yet, tho. Check it out - it supports the
native dongle that comes with the controller!

Also, let's all say "thank you" to @ehats for contributing the Xbox Elite 2
series controller support. He started from zero to mastering the HID
internals in just a few days with just a little help from me. I'm sure, a
vast amount of effort, a steep learning curve, and a lot of endurance and
probably also one beer or another went into this work. Leave him some kudos
for this awesome contribution, and expect more to follow. His work builds
the base for adding profile support and customization into the next xpadneo
version. He qualified for the quote of the day above.

A handful patches have been contributed which fix some smaller bugs:

  * Thanks to Adam Becker for adding some bug and style fixes.
  * Lars-SÃ¶ren Steck fixed a scripting bug, thank you.
  * Manjaro users now see instructions for their favorite distribution,
    thanks to @snpefk.

Let's not forget our testers, who have patiently been with us during the
development of this milestone: We appreciate your work, patience, and
contributions.

Many of the bug fixes have been backported to the v0.7 branch which has now
received its end of life. If you're having problems with the new features,
please report that and use the v0.7 branch until that specific bug is fixed.


## Breaking Changes

This version removed some module parameters with only partial replacement.
One of those if `disable_ff` which can no longer be used. Instead, there's
a new parameter `trigger_rumble_mode` which can disable trigger rumble
only. The next update will include a new parameter to set rumble attenuation
to 100% which translates to no rumble at all.
